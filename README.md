# Lab Carpentry: example resource sharing plan for grants

This repository contains example resource sharing plans for grants.
The purpose of these plans is to ensure that content produced from grants is openly released.

Examples are located in [`examples`](examples).

## Motivations

A good resource sharing plan helps avoid unanticipated hurdles and disagreements when it's time to release project content.
An explicit plan ensures that the universities, investigators, and funders involved in a grant are all on the same page regarding resource sharing.
Having a straightforward licensing arrangement can avoid delays down the road when seeking licensing approval from your university.
Resource sharing plans can impose legally-binding obligations for universities to openly license research.
Finally, a plan that commits to openness should make your proposal more attractive to funders.
