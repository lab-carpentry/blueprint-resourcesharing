# Lab Carpentry: a template resource sharing plan for grants

This repository contains a [template resource sharing plan](resource-sharing-plan.md) for grants.
The goal of the plan is to ensure project content created under the grant is openly released.

In instances where the University owns content produced under the grant, a well-crafted resource sharing plan is often the best way to ensure the open licensing of content.
Since Universities are generally the recipient of the grant and approve its content, a resource sharing plan can legally obligate a University allow the researchers to openly license their research.
Furthermore, an explicit resource sharing plan can prevent delays associated with receiving licensing approval from your University's licensing office.
