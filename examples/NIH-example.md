# NIH Resource Sharing Plan

This resource sharing plan was written by Daniel Himmelstein and Casey Greene in December 2016 for an NIH grant proposal.
The grant's field was biomedical informatics (Grant Number HG009516).
This plan commits to the open licensing of project content and makes a firm commitment to openness.

***

All outputs from this project — including code, data, figures, documentation, and manuscripts — will be made publicly available under an open license.
Code will be released under a [BSD 3-Clause License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause), a permissive open source software license.
Data will be released under the Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0, [version 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode "CC0 1.0 Universal") or later).
Figures, documentation, and writing will be released under a Creative Commons Attribution License ([version 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License") or later).

In addition to the aforementioned licensing for project outputs, creators of specific project content may release any such content as CC0, at their individual discretion.
The principal investigator of this project may release any project content as CC0, at his or her individual discretion.

In instances where upstream inputs are used that restrict the licensing of project outputs beyond the aforementioned guidelines, the most permissive licensing option possible will be applied.
However, no inputs will be incorporated that prevent original software from being released under an Open Source Initiative ([opensource.org](https://opensource.org/)) approved license or prevent original non-code content from being released under an Open Definition ([opendefinition.org](http://opendefinition.org/)) conformant license.

Source code will be made available on a publicly accessible version control system, such as GitHub.
Prior to submission of project manuscripts to a journal, all related outputs will be made publicly available under the aforementioned licensing guidelines and deposited to persistent archives.
Currently, the group uses [_Zenodo_](https://zenodo.org/) for code repositories, [_figshare_](https://figshare.com/) for datasets, and [_bioRxiv_](http://biorxiv.org/) for preprints, however the group may transition to alternatives if other options become more suitable during the course of the grant.
